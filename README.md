# Apple Guardian: Type Defense

A fast-paced typing practice game.

As apples fall from the sky, pesky bugs swarm in to devour them. Quickly type the correct characters to eliminate the pests before 
they reach your precious fruit. With each level, the challenge growsâ€”faster bugs, trickier words, and more apples to protect.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |
| `npm run dev-nolog` | Launch a development web server without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |
| `npm run build-nolog` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.

## Deploying to Production

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle and saved to the `dist` folder, along with any other assets your project imported, or stored in the public assets folder.

In order to deploy your game, you will need to upload *all* of the contents of the `dist` folder to a public facing web server.

## Customizing the Template

### Vite

If you want to customize your build, such as adding plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the `vite/config.*.mjs` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json`. Please see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more information.

## About log.js

If you inspect our node scripts you will see there is a file called `log.js`. This file makes a single silent API call to a domain called `gryzor.co`. This domain is owned by Phaser Studio Inc. The domain name is a homage to one of our favorite retro games.

We send the following 3 pieces of data to this API: The name of the template being used (vue, react, etc). If the build was 'dev' or 'prod' and finally the version of Phaser being used.

At no point is any personal data collected or sent. We don't know about your project files, device, browser or anything else. Feel free to inspect the `log.js` file to confirm this.

Why do we do this? Because being open source means we have no visible metrics about which of our templates are being used. We work hard to maintain a large and diverse set of templates for Phaser developers and this is our small anonymous way to determine if that work is actually paying off, or not. In short, it helps us ensure we're building the tools for you.

However, if you don't want to send any data, you can use these commands instead:

Dev:

```bash
npm run dev-nolog
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build-nolog
```

Or, to disable the log entirely, simply delete the file `log.js` and remove the call to it in the `scripts` section of `package.json`:

Before:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "node log.js dev & dev-template-script",
    "build": "node log.js build & build-template-script"
},
```

After:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "dev-template-script",
    "build": "build-template-script"
},
```

Either of these will stop `log.js` from running. If you do decide to do this, please could you at least join our Discord and tell us which template you're using! Or send us a quick email. Either will be super-helpful, thank you.
